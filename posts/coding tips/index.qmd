## Notes about github

How to commit and push changes to github?

1.  Make some changes to your files
2.  Render your website in Rstudio
3.  Commit your changes in github desktop with a commit message
4.  Push to github.com

## restarting R

session --> restart R

cmd-shift-f10

type .rs.restartR() in the console. THIS DID NOT WORK PROPERLY, the environment workspace did clear using this method.

## changing the picture for a post

quarto blogs will display a picture in the listing of posts

1. put a picture file (e.g.,jpg,png,gif) inside the folder for the post.
2. link to the picture with image: parameter in the .qmd yaml at the top of the document

the yaml for this document looks like:

## install.packages ("tidyverse")
installing packages into 'C:/users/staff/Documents/R/win-library/4.1'
(as 'lib' is unspecified)
trying URL 'https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/contrib/4.1/tidyverse_1.3.2.zip'

the main repository where packages reside is called CRAN

## difference between installing a package aznd loading a package

1. install.packages().
  it will be available but not loaded every time you open up R.
  
  ** never install a package from inside a scrip. only from console pane or the packages tab of the lower right pane. 
  
loading a package is done using the library() function. (aka. lauching an app)

run the function using beep()

if a package isn't loaded, use ?package_name::function_name
  

## themes and accessibility
used to change the font, size, and general appearance of R studio

1. go to tools
2. then global options
3. then appearance
